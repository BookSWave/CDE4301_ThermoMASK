# CDE4301 VR-403 ThermoMASK

## Brief Summary of Interim Report
ThermoMask is a research project aimed at enhancing immersion in Virtual Reality (VR) by adding thermal haptic feedback to the face. The project explores whether thermal referral—a phenomenon where thermal sensations are perceived in areas adjacent to the actual stimulus—exists on the human face and how it can be used to improve VR experiences.
