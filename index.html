        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Virtual reality (VR) is a game-changing creation that takes full advantage of technological advancements in recent years to improve immersion in content consumption, providing amazing visual and audio experiences.</p>

        <h2>Current VR Experience</h2>
        <p>VR is used not only in gaming but also in medical training and tourism, allowing users to experience realistic environments without leaving their room. Popular VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro offer high-resolution displays and spatial audio for enhanced visual and auditory experiences.</p>

        <p>Despite the great visual and audio experience offered by the VR headsets currently on the market, the overall VR experience is yet to be regarded as a perfect one. Touch is a significant sense for humans, and its inclusion is essential to create a fully immersive virtual reality experience. The lack of haptic feedback in current VR content consumption leaves a noticeable gap in achieving true realism. This gap is particularly evident in the way we perceive changes in texture and temperature, which are critical components of our tactile experience.</p>

        <h3>Thermal Feedback in VR Using Thermoelectric Coolers</h3>
        <p>Currently, the general method to provide thermal sensation is using thermoelectric coolers (TECs). Roshan Lalintha Peiris has done research exploring thermal haptic feedback on head mounted displays, integrating 10 TEC modules on the head mounted device, to enhance VR immersion through spatial and immersive thermal sensations on the face. Their system utilised TEC modules to provide both hot and cold feedback to specific locations on the face, enabling directional cueing. This research led to a conclusion that users found the system to be thermally immersive when all modules were activated with hot and cold stimulations (Peiris et al., 2017).</p>

        <h3>Thermal Referral</h3>
        <p>Thermal referral (TR) is a phenomenon where the sensation of temperature is felt not only at the site of the thermal stimulus but also at nearby locations, especially with concurrent tactile stimuli. TR is primarily attributed to the interaction of thermal and tactile inputs, where spatial integration in the brain leads to an illusory sensation of temperature at points with only tactile contact. This concept has been studied on human arms and backs, showing potential to enhance VR experiences through perceived thermal sensations.</p>

    <section id="research-methodologies">
        <h2>Research Methodologies</h2>
        <h3>Hardware Prototype</h3>
        <p>To validate our hypothesis, we designed a prototype consisting of a head-mounted device with TECs and LRAs to provide thermal and tactile feedback. The system is controlled by an ESP32 to ensure the desired temperatures are achieved for specific VR scenarios. The thermocouple constantly measures the temperature around the TECs, and the ESP32 compares the actual temperature to the desired setpoint. Based on the temperature readings, the ESP32 sends PWM signals to the TEC drivers to control the TEC modules.</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 8: Current hardware prototype for testing thermal referral on the face.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Temperature Control and Tactile Feedback</h3>
        <p>For tactile feedback, the ESP32 triggers the LRA DC motor drivers based on VR scene events or other input conditions. These drivers then control the haptic motors, creating vibration patterns that enhance immersion. For example, if a VR event involves touching a cold or warm object, the haptic motors could vibrate while the TEC adjusts the temperature to match the sensation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="limitations">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>After some user testing review of the prototype, there are a few limitations identified. The temperature of the TECs is not controlled accurately, potentially due to several factors. The hardware limitations of TEC modules require extra cooling aids to remove excess heat emitted while the TECs are working. If the excess heat is not removed, it will result in excessively high temperatures in warm situations and extra delay during cool situations. Extra passive or even active cooling methods should be considered to improve the accuracy of TEC temperatures.</p>
        <p>The connections for different components on the prototype, especially for the LRAs and TECs, are not stable. The wirings connecting them break very often, leading to broken circuits. The metallic outer shell of the LRA motor leads to potential short circuits, despite trying to insulate the shell with insulating tapes. These connection issues lead to frequent malfunctions of the prototype, which should be solved. Adding additional coatings on the motor or using another model of the motor may be considered, together with better circuit design that holds the components more securely.</p>

    <section id="experimental-design">
        <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
        <h3>Experiment 1</h3>
        <p>To validate hypothesis 1, we designed user experiment 1 to determine the presence of thermal referral on human faces, and whether its strength is related to the frequency of LRA vibration. We will use the hardware prototype for participants to experience different combinations of vibration and thermal sensations, with step-by-step instructions in the UI to guide them through the experiment while collecting data needed for the experiment.</p>
        <p>To collect data from the participants, a self-created user interface (UI) will be used, allowing the participant to finish the whole experiment by themselves with clear instructions. The operations include rating the strength of thermal stimulus and subjectively drawing the location of thermal sensations for various scenarios. We will provide ample time for the skin to rest between different stimulations, as indicated by the cooldown timing in the UI.</p>
        <h3>Experiment 2</h3>
        <p>To validate hypothesis 2, we designed experiment 2, to develop a thermo-haptic device that can be mounted on VR headsets and to explore the effects of thermal referral on usersâ€™ facial regions to enhance the VR experience. We will be mounting the prototype onto the Meta Quest 3 headset to incorporate the thermal haptic feedback into VR scenarios.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
        <p>We have identified a gap in current VR experiences: the lack of research on thermal referral and thermal haptic feedback on the face. Our research hypothesises that thermal referral exists on the human face and is influenced by vibration frequency, and that utilising this phenomenon can enhance VR immersion.</p>
        <p>Our immediate focus is to refine the prototype by improving cooling mechanisms for the TECs and enhancing circuit stability to prevent malfunctions. Once optimised, we will proceed with experiment 1 to test the existence of thermal referral on the face and its relationship to vibration frequency, involving at least 12 participants. Subsequently, experiment 2 will integrate the refined prototype with a VR headset to evaluate how facial thermal feedback affects immersion in a virtual environment. This will help validate whether utilising thermal referral can improve the VR experience.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, we hope to contribute to the development of more immersive VR technology by incorporating comprehensive thermal haptic feedback, addressing a significant deficiency in current VR systems.</p>
